      <p>I’m a big creator in the world of media. I graduated from the school of Electronic Media and Communication where I obtained a wealth of knowledge surrounding all media.</p>

      <p>I took an internship at an Austin radio station where I received experience sampling all the roles that make up radio. I’ve created many videos myself and edited many others with a fun gaming setting.</p>

      <p>Now, I’m really taking a dive into what makes up all of this media by going into a rigorous coding boot camp where I can learn to create whatever I want.</p>
